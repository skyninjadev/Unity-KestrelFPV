# KestrelFPV

I have always been eager to fly a drone through FPV goggles, but was always too afraid to break anything during the first flights. A simulator was the perfect way to practice before getting serious, but unfortunately few free solutions can be found online, so I decided to make my own.

KestrelFPV is a quadcopter simulator made with Unity3D. It is meant as a tool to learn how to fly a drone in Acro/Rate mode in First-Person-View.

## Features

* Realistic simulation of motors, propellers and aerodynamics.
* Tuneable flight controller, including several modes such as Stabilized and Manual angles and height control.
* Multiplayer FPV racing game mode.
* Several 3D scenes available: Viking Village, Forest, Stadium.
* Several type of cameras: FPV, Follow, and Eye-level.
* Drone 3D model of the Parrot Bebop Drone.
